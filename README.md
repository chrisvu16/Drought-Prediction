# Drought Prediction Project
## Overview
This project aims to predict drought occurrences using various machine learning models. We employed data collection, preprocessing, dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and developed classification models to achieve high accuracy and robustness. This project was a collaborative effort, culminating in a detailed paper demonstrating our methodology, model performance, and results.
