# Drought Prediction Project
## Overview
This project aims to predict drought occurrences using various machine-learning models. We employed data collection, preprocessing, dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and developed classification models to achieve high accuracy and robustness. This project was a collaborative effort, culminating in a detailed paper demonstrating our methodology, model performance, and results.
## Project Description
The goal of this project is to predict future droughts in California using machine learning techniques. We used data from multiple reputable sources, applied PCA for dimensionality reduction, and trained several models to predict drought occurrences.
## Data Collection
We collected data from various reputable websites, including:
- Average Precipitation and Temperature from every county in California
- Snowpack Levels from different regions 
- Reservoir Levels from different regions
- Previous years of California's drought status
## Data Preprocessing
The preprocessing steps included:
-Cleaning the datasets
-Handling missing values
-Standardizing the features
## Dimensionality Reduction
We used dimensionality reduction techniques to enhance computational efficiency and model performance:
- Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Conducted correlation matrix analysis to identify significant features
## Model Development
We developed and evaluated several machine learning models:
- Lasso Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
We used cross-validation to ensure the consistency and robustness of the models.
## Evaluation Metrics
We evaluated the models using the following metrics:
- MSE
- R-2 Score
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix
## Results
The Decision Tree Classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 92.6%. Detailed comparison tables and charts were used to discuss the trade-offs between different models.
